Jour_3_1;Oh, hi kitty, didn’t see you there ;a
Jour_3_2;"You know I was wondering; do you think I made the right decision studying here?";a
Jour_3_3;"I mean, sure I met you; I met Benjamin and I got to stay with Lena";a
Jour_3_4;but sometimes I wonder what if Mom was right?;a
Jour_3_5;What if I don’t get a job after this, how am I going to pay back my loan?;a
Jour_3_6;How am I going to pay for my apartment and most importantly the food??;a
Jour_3_7;I don’t know, maybe I’m just tired from watching videos too late on my phone again. ;a
Jour_3_8;Ah yes, you’re right I’ve got to feed you.;a
Jour_3_9;Mhh, how about chicken today? ;a
Jour_3_10;Looks good to me, here you go kitty. I’m going to the sofa, are you coming?;a
Jour_3_11;Sigh You know what nevermind.;a
Jour_3_12; I’m going on the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_3_13;What th- MILO. As if worrying about my future wasn’t enough;a
Jour_3_14;I must worry about you destroying my trash can too??;a
Jour_3_15;Get out of here, go wait for me on the sofa instead of doing stuff like this.;a
Jour_3_16;I love you too kitty, you’re right I am worrying too much.;a
Jour_3_17;I should just drink this coffee. Well, let’s go on the sofa.;a
Jour_3_18;Sigh Yeah, I have to go shower too but for now,;a
Jour_3_19;I’m going on the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_3_20;I can meow too you know.;a
Jour_3_21;Instead of meowing come with me on the sofa so I can drink my coffee peacefully. ;a
Jour_3_22;That was an aggressive meow.;a
Jour_3_23;I don’t know why you aren’t happy again but I’m going to the sofa to drink this coffee.;a
Jour_3_24;You’re coming?;a
Jour_3_25;AHHH (happy relaxed), I made a great decision when buying this couch.;a
Jour_3_26;After this, I’ll go shower and then I have a class with Mr. Virtanen, I’m going to do my presentation about Pilvi Takala;a
Jour_3_27;It should go well. I revised a lot with Benji, and I know well this artist.;a
Jour_3_28;I really like her you know. We’ve been friends since what?;a
Jour_3_29;High school? And yet she’s still the same crazy goofball that played football on Fridays after school and ate cookies in math class.;a
Jour_3_30;It feels like something has changed since last week though.;a
Jour_3_31;She’s been making a lot of eye-contacts and she’s been more touchy than usual.;a
Jour_3_32; I wonder if something’s up. What do you think?;a
Jour_3_33;*Chuckles* - Yeah, I agree. She’s awesome. Do you know what she did yesterday??;a
Jour_3_34;She bargained with Mr. Virtanen to be paired with me for our final term assignment.;a
Jour_3_35;I think she might have used up all her luck for the year.;a
Jour_3_36;I think I’ll ask her to go to grab lunch with me soon.;a
Jour_3_37;That way we can talk about something else than class.;a
Jour_3_38;Sometimes I wonder what you would say if you could talk for real.;a
Jour_3_39;Nonetheless, know that I am going to ask her if we can eat together this week.;a
Jour_3_40;Maybe going to eat pizzas or even burgers maybe?;a
Jour_3_41;I’m excited about it, she’s sooooo pretty and I love the way her lips curl up every time she sees me it’s as if I was a sun or something.;a
Jour_3_42;I can see you care more about your kibbles buuut you’re going to have to support me a bit longer.;a
Jour_3_43;Sometimes I forget you’re a cat and you care more about licking your fur than listening to me, for as much as you can understand.;a
Jour_3_44; Nonetheless, know that I am going to ask her if we can eat together this week.;a
Jour_3_45;Maybe going to eat pizzas or even burgers maybe?;a
Jour_3_46;I’m excited about it, she’s sooooo pretty and I love the way her lips curl up every time she sees me it’s as if I was a sun or something.;a
Jour_3_47;I can see you care more about your kibbles buuut you’re going to have to support me a bit longer.;a
Jour_3_48;Really? You don’t like her?;a
Jour_3_49;You never even met her, she’s basically in love with you and she’s always asking me for photos of you.;a
Jour_3_50;How can you meow like that at her, it’s unfair Milo.;a
Jour_3_51;You know what?;a
Jour_3_52;If she ever comes here, you’ll be able to meow like that okay?;a
Jour_3_53;For now, just go into the living room if you’re so mad.;a
Jour_3_54;Milo, where are you going?;a
Jour_3_55;Footsteps What is- I told you not to do this! You got your scratching post over there you know this. Sigh;a
Jour_3_56;Sometimes I wonder if you do this just to annoy me or if you’re just a clueless cat. Sigh;a
Jour_3_57;I hope for you that Lena won’t notice when she comes because that would be embarrassing for you and me.;a
Jour_3_58;Milo, where are you going? Footsteps What is- You're eating my plant again?? ;a
Jour_3_59;Milo, you know it’s not good for your health, you always end up vomiting everywhere why do you do this?;a
Jour_3_60;Sigh You will not sleep in my bed or my room tonight I promise you,;a
Jour_3_61; I’m seeing Lena tomorrow and I want to ask her to go get lunch with me during the week,;a

Jour_5_5;Really? That’s awesome! Did something happen or..?;a
Jour_5_6;Maybe...;a
Jour_5_7;Wouldn’t it be because of someone whose name starts with L?;a
Jour_5_8;It might be...;a
Jour_5_9;Yes, it is.;a
Jour_5_10;I KNEW IT, I TOLD YOU AND YOU WERE LIKE “no, we’re only friends gngngngn”.;a
Jour_5_11;I. KNEW. IT.;a
Jour_5_12;You sneaky woman, I saw it from the beginning.;a
Jour_5_13;Yeah, yeah, you were right. We kinda went on a date today? I think it was a date.;a
Jour_5_14;Why do you think? Why wouldn’t it be?;a
Jour_5_15;We never made it clear so I’m not sure, but we still held hands and shopped outfits for each other, she even got us matching keychains!;a
Jour_5_16;Yeah, that’s what you call a date idiot.;a
Jour_5_17;I knew she had a thing for you, it showed.;a
Jour_5_18;What do you mean it showed??;a
Jour_5_19;Since I met you, she’s always been so protective of you.;a
Jour_5_20;Always standing by your side, bringing you snacks and offering you her jacket if you were cold.;a
Jour_5_21;What? But we’ve been doing this for each other since high school, that’s just what best friends do.;a
Jour_5_22;Is it?;a
Jour_5_23;...;a
Jour_5_24;Milo is purring. I think he’s trying to tell me you’re right.;a
Jour_5_25;Benji, how could I be so oblivious all this time? I’m so damn blind that’s insane.;a
Jour_5_26;Yeah, you kinda are.;a
Jour_5_27;Not. Helping. Benjamin.;a
Jour_5_28;Wait a sec Benji, Milo is meowing, and I don’t know why. What’s going on Milo?;a
Jour_5_29;Maybe he’s trying to tell you that I was right.;a
Jour_5_30;He’s my cat, he always agrees with me.;a
Jour_5_31;That’s what you think.;a
Jour_5_32;That’s the truth.;a
Jour_5_33;Or... is it?;a
Jour_5_34;...;a
Jour_5_35;Dammit, how could I be so oblivious all this time?;a
Jour_5_36;Love is certainly blind with you.;a
Jour_5_37;Yeah, it is.;a
Jour_5_38;Let’s just say I’ll let you believe in your dreams.;a
Jour_5_39;I’m telling the truth!;a
Jour_5_40;Seems more like you are being delusional to me.;a
Jour_5_41;I’m not.;a
Jour_5_42;You kinda are though.;a
Jour_5_43;....;a
Jour_5_44;Dammit.;a
Jour_5_45;What’s that noise? Where’s Milo??;a
Jour_5_46;I think he left because you were too delusional.;a
Jour_5_47;Not funny Benji. Dammit Milo, no!;a
Jour_5_48;What is he doing?;a
Jour_5_49;He’s messing with the trash can again, that’s the 3rd time this week!;a
Jour_5_50;BAHAHA, I wish I could see that.;a
Jour_5_51;No, you don’t.;a
Jour_5_52;I do.;a
Jour_5_53;Wait a sec Benji, Milo is meowing like crazy. What’s going on Milo?;a
Jour_5_54;"He must be really loud; I hear him through the phone.";a
Jour_5_55;He is. I don’t know what he wants. What is it kitty? Are you hungry? Do you want some cuddles?;a
Jour_5_56;I know someone who would looove some cuddles.;a
Jour_5_57;Shut up Benji, not the right time.;a
Jour_5_58;Sorry Laur’, I’m messing with you. I’m happy for both of you.;a
Jour_5_59;It’s okay Benji, that’s not your fault.;a
Jour_5_60;Dammit, how could I be so oblivious all this time?;a
Jour_5_61;Love is certainly blind with you.;a
Jour_5_62;It’s okay Laur’, maybe it was for the best. You can enjoy it to the fullest now. Tell her, I’ll kick her ass if she hurts you though.;a
Jour_5_63;We’re not even dating!;a
Jour_5_64;Yet, not even dating yet.;a
Jour_5_65;You’re so annoying!;a
Jour_5_66;But you love me.;a

Jour_6_3;You make it better, even when you eat stuff you’re not supposed to. At least, it gets me out of my head.;a
Jour_6_4;I love you too kitty, thank you for sticking with me all this time.;a
Jour_6_5;I’m going to drink this coffee on the sofa. Are you coming?;a
Jour_6_6;Sigh Yeah, I have to go shower too but for now, I’m going on the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_6_7;I can meow too you know. Instead of meowing come with me on the sofa so I can drink my coffee peacefully.;a
Jour_6_8;That was an aggressive meow.;a
Jour_6_9;I don’t know why you aren’t happy again but I’m going to the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_6_10;Ah yes, you’re right I’ve got to feed you.;a
Jour_6_11;Mhh, how about beef today? Looks good to me, here you go kitty. I’m going to the sofa, are you coming?;a
Jour_6_12;Sigh You know what nevermind. I’m going on the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_6_13;What th- MILO.;a
Jour_6_14;You must stop doing this, I am going to have to buy a heavier trash can if you continue and I don’t have the money for that.;a
Jour_6_15;Get out of here, go wait for me on the sofa instead.;a
Jour_6_16;This couch has a gift to make you feel better, come here kitty. Here you go.;a
Jour_6_17;I think Lena will love this.;a
Jour_6_18;Aaand I’m done!;a
Jour_6_19;What do you think?;a
Jour_6_20;*chuckles* Do you like it too? I’m glad. I painted you since she loves you so much.;a
Jour_6_21;I must say you look handsome on this canvas.;a
Jour_6_22;"I’ll give it to her tomorrow; she’s coming to work on our project.";a
Jour_6_23;Maybe we could sleepover?;a
Jour_6_24;I don’t know but I’m so excited to see her.;a
Jour_6_25;I’d love to know what you mean when you’re meowing like that. Sigh;a
Jour_6_26;Anyway, I painted you since she loves you so much.;a
Jour_6_27;I must say you look handsome on this canvas.;a
Jour_6_28;"I’ll give it to her tomorrow; she’s coming to work on our project.";a
Jour_6_29;Maybe we could sleepover?;a
Jour_6_30;I don’t know but I’m so excited to see her.;a

Jour_6_32;Anyway, I painted you since she loves you so much.;a
Jour_6_33;I must say you look handsome on this canvas.;a

Jour_6_35;Maybe we could sleepover?;a
Jour_6_36;I don’t know but I’m so excited to see her.;a
Jour_6_37;Wow chill dude, I know my art is not a Da Vinci, but it still deserves some respect.;a
Jour_6_38;Maybe I shouldn’t have painted you after all. I hope she will like it even though it’s not as good as I had hoped it’d be.;a
Jour_6_39;"I’ll give it to her tomorrow; she’s coming to work on our project.";a
Jour_6_40;Maybe we could sleepover?;a
Jour_6_41;I don’t know but I’m excited to see her.;a
Jour_6_42;*chuckles* I’m guessing it means you love it, right? I’m glad. I painted you since she loves you so much.;a
Jour_6_43;I must say you look handsome on this canvas.;a
Jour_6_44;"I’ll give it to her tomorrow; she’s coming to work on our project.";a
Jour_6_45;Maybe we could sleepover?;a
Jour_6_46;I don’t know but I’m so excited to see her.;a
Jour_6_47;That’s your way of saying you don’t care, I guess.;a
Jour_6_48;Anyway, I painted you since she loves you so much.;a
Jour_6_49;I must say you look handsome on this canvas.;a
Jour_6_50;"I’ll give it to her tomorrow; she’s coming to work on our project.";a

Jour_6_53;Milo, for the hundredth time, NO. You. Cannot. Eat. Plants.;a
Jour_6_54;You’re impossible. Sigh;a
Jour_6_55;Maybe I shouldn’t have painted you after all. You don’t deserve it when you do things like that.;a

Jour_6_57;Maybe we could sleepover?;a
Jour_6_58;I don’t know but I’m excited to see her.;a
