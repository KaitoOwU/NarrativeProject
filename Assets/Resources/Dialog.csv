Jour_2_34;Not feeling like helping me huh?;a

Jour_3_1;Oh, hi kitty, didn’t see you there ;a
Jour_3_2;"You know I was wondering; do you think I made the right decision studying here?";a
Jour_3_3;"I mean, sure I met you; I met Benjamin and I got to stay with Lena";a
Jour_3_4;but sometimes I wonder what if Mom was right?;a
Jour_3_5;What if I don’t get a job after this, how am I going to pay back my loan?;a
Jour_3_6;How am I going to pay for my apartment and most importantly the food??;a
Jour_3_7;I don’t know, maybe I’m just tired from watching videos too late on my phone again. ;a
Jour_3_8;Ah yes, you’re right I’ve got to feed you.;a
Jour_3_9;Mhh, how about chicken today? ;a
Jour_3_10;Looks good to me, here you go kitty. I’m going to the sofa, are you coming?;a
Jour_3_11;Sigh You know what nevermind.;a
Jour_3_12; I’m going on the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_3_13;What th- MILO. As if worrying about my future wasn’t enough;a
Jour_3_14;I must worry about you destroying my trash can too??;a
Jour_3_15;Get out of here, go wait for me on the sofa instead of doing stuff like this.;a
Jour_3_16;I love you too kitty, you’re right I am worrying too much.;a
Jour_3_17;I should just drink this coffee. Well, let’s go on the sofa.;a
Jour_3_18;Sigh Yeah, I have to go shower too but for now,;a
Jour_3_19;I’m going on the sofa to drink this coffee. You’re coming?;a
Jour_3_20;I can meow too you know.;a
Jour_3_21;Instead of meowing come with me on the sofa so I can drink my coffee peacefully. ;a
Jour_3_22;That was an aggressive meow.;a
Jour_3_23;I don’t know why you aren’t happy again but I’m going to the sofa to drink this coffee.;a
Jour_3_24;You’re coming?;a
Jour_3_25;AHHH (happy relaxed), I made a great decision when buying this couch.;a
Jour_3_26;After this, I’ll go shower and then I have a class with Mr. Virtanen, I’m going to do my presentation about Pilvi Takala;a
Jour_3_27;It should go well. I revised a lot with Benji, and I know well this artist.;a
Jour_3_28;I really like her you know. We’ve been friends since what?;a
Jour_3_29;High school? And yet she’s still the same crazy goofball that played football on Fridays after school and ate cookies in math class.;a
Jour_3_30;It feels like something has changed since last week though.;a
Jour_3_31;She’s been making a lot of eye-contacts and she’s been more touchy than usual.;a
Jour_3_32; I wonder if something’s up. What do you think?;a
Jour_3_33;*Chuckles* - Yeah, I agree. She’s awesome. Do you know what she did yesterday??;a
Jour_3_34;She bargained with Mr. Virtanen to be paired with me for our final term assignment.;a
Jour_3_35;I think she might have used up all her luck for the year.;a
Jour_3_36;I think I’ll ask her to go to grab lunch with me soon.;a
Jour_3_37;That way we can talk about something else than class.;a
Jour_3_38;Sometimes I wonder what you would say if you could talk for real.;a
Jour_3_39;Nonetheless, know that I am going to ask her if we can eat together this week.;a
Jour_3_40;Maybe going to eat pizzas or even burgers maybe?;a
Jour_3_41;I’m excited about it, she’s sooooo pretty and I love the way her lips curl up every time she sees me it’s as if I was a sun or something.;a
Jour_3_42;I can see you care more about your kibbles buuut you’re going to have to support me a bit longer.;a
Jour_3_43;Sometimes I forget you’re a cat and you care more about licking your fur than listening to me, for as much as you can understand.;a
Jour_3_44; Nonetheless, know that I am going to ask her if we can eat together this week.;a
Jour_3_45;Maybe going to eat pizzas or even burgers maybe?;a
Jour_3_46;I’m excited about it, she’s sooooo pretty and I love the way her lips curl up every time she sees me it’s as if I was a sun or something.;a
Jour_3_47;I can see you care more about your kibbles buuut you’re going to have to support me a bit longer.;a
Jour_3_48;Really? You don’t like her?;a
Jour_3_49;You never even met her, she’s basically in love with you and she’s always asking me for photos of you.;a
Jour_3_50;How can you meow like that at her, it’s unfair Milo.;a
Jour_3_51;You know what?;a
Jour_3_52;If she ever comes here, you’ll be able to meow like that okay?;a
Jour_3_53;For now, just go into the living room if you’re so mad.;a
Jour_3_54;Milo, where are you going?;a
Jour_3_55;Footsteps What is- I told you not to do this! You got your scratching post over there you know this. Sigh;a
Jour_3_56;Sometimes I wonder if you do this just to annoy me or if you’re just a clueless cat. Sigh;a
Jour_3_57;I hope for you that Lena won’t notice when she comes because that would be embarrassing for you and me.;a
Jour_3_58;Milo, where are you going? Footsteps What is- You're eating my plant again?? ;a
Jour_3_59;Milo, you know it’s not good for your health, you always end up vomiting everywhere why do you do this?;a
Jour_3_60;Sigh You will not sleep in my bed or my room tonight I promise you,;a
Jour_3_61; I’m seeing Lena tomorrow and I want to ask her to go get lunch with me during the week,;a
Jour_3_62;So I don’t need you to stain my outfit because of your nonsense;a
